Problem
Given an array A , having N integers A1,A2...An.Two elements of the array Ai and Aj are called similar iff Ai=Aj+1 or Aj=Ai+1 .
Also, the similarity follows transitivity. If Ai and Aj are similar and Aj and Ak are similar, then Ai and Ak are also similar. 
Note: i, j, and k are all distinct.

You need to find number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Ai is similar to Aj.

Input

The first line contains a single integer  N denoting number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space separated integers where ith  elements indicate Ai.

Output

Output the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Ai is similar to Aj in a single line.

Input
8
1 3 5 7 8 2 5 7
Output
6
Explanation
We have  possible pairs of indices which contain similar elements.
(1,6): A1 and A6 are similar since 2=1+1.
(2,6): A2 and A6 are similar since 3=2+1.
(1,2): A1 and A6 are similar by transitivity since A1 and A6 are similar, so A2 and A6 are also similar.
(4,5): A4 and A5 are similar since 8=7+1.
(5,8): A5 and A8 are similar since 8=7+1.
(4,8): A4 and A8 are similar by transitivity since A4 and A5 are similar, so A5 and A8 are also similar.
